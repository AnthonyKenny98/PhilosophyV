# Philosophy V :book:
>A RISC-V Processor implemented in Verilog 

*Philosophy IV*, written in 1903 by [Mr. Owen Wister of the Class of 1882](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Owen_Wister), recounts the antics of two Harvard students and their last minute attempts to study (or avoid studying) for an exam for which they are hopelessly unprepared. Similarly, this repository holds my last minute attempt to build a RISC-V processor for my Senior Thesis, a task for which I am unsure of my preparedness.
As such, I name my processor Philosphy V; both in reference to the RISC-V ISA for which it is designed, and to the fact that my current situation seems much like a sequel to Mr. Wister's novell.
